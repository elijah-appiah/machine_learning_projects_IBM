# IBM Data Science Lab Projects 
Python lab project organized by the International Business Machine (IBM) for the courses "Data Analysis with Python" and "Machine Learning with Python"; and offered through Coursera.

## Data Analysis with Python
The lab project comprises a **Linear Regression with Machine Learning Algorithm** on "House Sales of King County, USA" dataset. The steps in this project include:
* Data Wrangling
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Model Development: Linear Regression
* Model Evaluation and Refinement

_The notebook's filename as committed to the repository is: **IBM_project_notebook_Final_Assignment.ipynb**_

## Machine Learning with Python
The lab project comprises **Classification Algorithms (KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression)** on a past loans dataset. The steps in the project include:
* Data Visualization and Pre-processing (Feature Selection/Extraction)
* K Nearest Neighbors Classification Algorithm
* Decision Tree
* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression
* Model Evaluation using Test Set
* Report on the Metrics for the Algorithms
